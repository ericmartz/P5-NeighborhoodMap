- Update JSON request.  It should return the information needed, and then I should update
  the view from KO.

- Change how markers work.  They should probably become part of the KO OA.

  - Probably involve a lot of re-wiring.  map.js will probably become a helper file.

- Need to change how the infoWindows gets its info for display.  This should be part of the KO View.
